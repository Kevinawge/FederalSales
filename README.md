# Data Cleaning and Analysis of U.S. Federal Oil & Gas Sales

## About

Understanding how natural resources contribute to federal revenue is key to energy policy, environmental planning, and economic strategy. This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing federal oil, gas, and natural gas liquid (NGL) sales data collected from U.S. onshore and offshore federal lands. The dataset was sourced from the Department of the Interiorâ€™s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) and spans calendar years 2013 through 2023.

Through structured SQL processes, I cleaned the data for consistency, corrected known entry errors, and engineered new metrics to better reflect revenue efficiency. I then conducted comprehensive analysis to uncover trends in royalty generation, evaluate differences across regions and land categories, and identify how transportation costs and commodity types influence overall revenue. The final insights support transparency in natural resource reporting and offer a data-driven foundation for strategic decision-making.
